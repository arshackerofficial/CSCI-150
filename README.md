**Course Description:**

This course introduces students to the basic concepts of digital logic design and the function and use of typical digital components belonging primarily to the small and medium-scale integration (SSI, MSI) families. The design principles will be used to develop an understanding of how the functional capabilities can be provided by hardware for the operation of a microprocessor. Additionally, this course will introduce the student to machine language, its relationship to the design of a computer, and its symbolic representation as assembly language. The assembly language of a particular CPU will be used to illustrate machine language programming concepts. An interactive logic simulation environment for designing and testing logic circuit design will be used for the assignments.

**Course Learning Outcomes:**

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the basic concepts of digital logic design.
- Use digital components belonging to SSI and MSI families.
- Understand the functional capabilities provided by hardware for microprocessor operation.
- Develop machine language programming concepts.
- Use assembly language to illustrate machine language programming.
- Design and test logic circuits using an interactive logic simulation environment.
