### Description
This course introduces the basics of digital logic design and the use of small and medium-scale integration (SSI/MSI) components. You’ll connect design principles to how hardware supports a microprocessor, and you’ll be introduced to machine language and assembly. An interactive logic simulation environment is used for design/testing.

### Learning Outcomes
By the end, you should be able to:
- Understand core digital logic concepts.
- Use SSI/MSI digital components.
- Explain how hardware provides microprocessor functionality.
- Grasp machine language programming concepts.
- Use assembly to illustrate machine language.
- Design and test logic circuits with a simulator.
